Everything worked before, but it felt a bit cheating to expose the backend.
Now port also port 8080 goes through the ngnix proxy.

Maiin additions:
ngnix.conf:
  server {
    listen 8080;

    location / {
      proxy_pass http://back208:8080/;
    }

docker-compose.yml:
  nginx:
...
    ports:
...
      - 8080:8080 # accordingly removed from the backend
