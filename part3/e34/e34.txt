Baseline(before):

rvl@eb: e34 $ docker images

Base was supposed to be ubuntu:18.04, rebased here:

rvl@eb: e34 $ docker images
REPOSITORY                TAG           IMAGE ID       CREATED              SIZE

After joining and purging

rvl@eb: e34 $ docker images                                                                                                                                         
REPOSITORY                TAG           IMAGE ID       CREATED             SIZE

Not quite "432MB / 351MB", but maybe a good enough change, as we have better size optimisations ahead.
